# Declutter WP

A plugin for WordPress that shows visitors a clean temporary website when undergoing maintenance.

## Description

The plugin informs visitors and search engines that the downtime is temporary. A clean temporary website is shown to anyone who's not a logged in user with admin rights. A 503 HTTP status code and `Retry-After: 3600` provides relevant info for search engines. The plugin is simple by design, because it's meant to be comfortable and fast.
